                <p class = 'project_par'> The results from my bachelor thesis did not correspond to expectations (see below). 
                  Reflecting on possible reasons behind it, the measurement of political attitudes seemed to be a good candidate
                  for further improvement. A careful application of a dictionary-based Sentiment Analysis coupled with Name Entity Recognition, seemed 
                  to have fail at capturing users' political attitude. Specifically, it seemed to average out extreme opinions of single users. The improvement 
                  involved separating the measurement of the opinion's polarity from the measurement of its strength. The former was assessed using a pre-trained Suport Vector Machine 
                  classifying posts as pro or against the political ideology, based on their network of Twitter followers and followings. The latter measurment involved sentiment analysis in 
                  absolute terms (i.e. 0 = weak opinion; 5 = very strong opinion). The same analysis as in the bachelor thesis was performed using this new metric. 
                  Results show that the new mesaurement solved the problem the previous method showed, and political attitdues distributions were indeed showing bimodality. 
                  Nevertheless, no increase in the extremity of this bimodality as a function of political involvement was observed. </p>

                 <p class = 'project_par'> This was my Bachelor's Thesis project entitled: <i style="margin: 0px;">Using Social Media Analytics to Explore Political 
                  Involvement and Polarization: Challenges and New Insight</i>. It go awarded a 9. Here is the abstract:             
                  <i style="margin: 0px;"> "When applied to political attitudes, the Cusp Catastrophe model predicts that people with a high
                    political involvement will hold extreme political attitudes (i.e. will be more polarized). We tested
                    this prediction by fitting a Cusp Catastrophe model to data regarding political involvement and
                    attitude towards Joe Biden, obtained using Twitter Analytics and Natural Language Processing.
                    Political involvement was measured using a dictionary approach: how many of a user’s last 100
                    posts contained ‘political terms’ and thus could be considered political. Attitude towards Joe Biden
                    was measured by performing a Sentiment Analysis on those posts in which the user mentioned only
                    Joe Biden and no other political/social figure (this filtering was accomplished using Name Entity
                    Recognition). The Cusp Catastrophe model showed a poor fit to this data, pointing at political
                    involvement being unrelated to extremity of political attitudes."</i>

                  This study evaluates the correspondece between songs' objective valence judgement (i.e. Spotify's valence metric) and 
                  subjective happiness ratings (i.e. measured using a questionnaire). Additionally, many studies have shown that musical 
                  sophistication has an effect on the relationship between objective and subjective musical perception (Castro & Lima, 2014).
                   We will examine whether the level of expertise in music will impact musical perception in the context of valence, leading to
                    the following research question: To what extent does objective valence judgement predict subjective happiness ratings and to what extent is this relationship moderated by music sophistication? 
                  I was in charge of the data cleaning and analysis process, as well as the data visualization. I tested the main hypothesis of 
                  both valence metrics being related applying a Simple Linear Regression. I evaluated wether music sophistication altered this 
                  relationship using a Moderation Analysis. We also wanted to test wehther participants with a higher musical sophistication 
                  'agreed more' on the valence judgement of songs. I tested this using Levene's test on each song. </p>

               <p class = 'project_par'> The clearity and aesthetics of visualizations are rareley valued in 
                scientific education. Thus I spend some free time improving this aspects of my visualization skills. 
                This summer my family and I (i.e. the Chulvi family) decided to do a small gastronomic around our homotown
                (i.e. Valenci, Spain). We evaluated restaurants based on different criteria which, in turn, had different weights. 
                By the end of the tour, having gathered this data, I decided to create a small visualization. The goal was, not only
                to be able to tell what restaurant, but to also see what criteria each resturant excelled/failed at. This would also allow
                the reader to make an informed dicsion, in case he was most interested in one criteria (e.g. food quality) than another (e.g. service quality).</p>

             <p class = 'project_par'> This project involved following a very common method of questionnaire construction and validation in Pscyhology. 
              We attempted to create a measurement of a person's general mistrust tendency. This effort was grounded in previous literature, which lead to
              the segmentation of the questionnaire in different 'dimensions' for different aspects of mistrust. Thus, a way of evaluating the questionnaire 
              was to perform a confirmatory factor analysis (i.e. similiar to PCA) and test if items linked to a same dimension of mistrust clustered together.
